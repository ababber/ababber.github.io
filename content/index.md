> Welcome to my blog! My name is Ankit Babber, and in this blog you'll find useful information related to software development. Most of the posts on my blog are about things I am working on or have worked on. If you have any questions related to a post, please contact me with the specific link as a reference. You can find my contact information on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ababber). Also, if you like how this blog looks, then I covered how I setup my blog in a previous post titled [How to Create a Blog with Quartz, GitHub, and Cloudflare](./2025/02/06-how-to-create-a-blog-with-quartz-github-and-cloudflare.md).
